This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and trying to render items with dynamic height.  The issue is that `FlatList` needs an estimated height for each item to optimize rendering. If the actual height varies significantly, it can lead to inaccurate calculations and unexpected layout behavior. This often manifests as blank spaces, incorrect item positioning, or performance issues.
